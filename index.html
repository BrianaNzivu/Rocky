                    where I see myself in 5 years...jeez Samantha I am in my mysetrious girl era...jokes
                    My name is Briana Nzivu. I am old enough to wish to be a child again. I enjoy gardening
                    (I don't care if it's a hobby for old people) and drawing animation characters. In fact 
                    I think in an 'parallel' universe I probably write and draw anime and manga. In 5 years I see myself 
                    definately working a remote job and having a few projects here and there generating some side income.

                  <p class="person-description">Heyyyy!! My name is Samantha Folashade and I am a whole 24 years shadey individual
                    in this planet called mars, oh wait that's a book, I meant earth. I love reading books at my free time 
                    and my favorite author is Sidney Sheldon. I enjoy teaching IT and my dream is to one day open a centre 
                    where I can teach basic IT skills to those who are underprivileged.
