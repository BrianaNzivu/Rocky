Heyyyy!! My name is Samantha Folashade and I am a whole 24 years individual in this planet called mars, oh wait that's a book, I meant earth. I love reading books at my free time and my favorite author is Sidney Sheldon. I enjoy teaching IT and my dream is to one day open a centre where I can teach basic IT skills to those who are underprivileged.
