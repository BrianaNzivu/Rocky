Hey there!So Samantha told us to say our name, age, interest and where I see myself in 5 years...jeez Samantha I am in my mysetrious girl era...jokes
My name is Briana Nzivu. I am old enough to wish to be a child again. I enjoy gardening (I don't care if it's a hobby for old people) and drawing animation characters. In fact I think in an 'parallel' universe I probably write and draw anime and manga. In 5 years I see myself definately working a remote job and having a few projects here and there generating some side income.
